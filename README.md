## 📘 Overview
This repository documents my learning journey while auditing the **Xcelerium Training Program**, a hands-on technical training organized and funded by **Xcelerium**, an IC design company.  
The program is designed to prepare selected trainees for full-time internship opportunities in the field of **semiconductor and integrated circuit design**.

Although I am auditing the training, I’m following the same tasks and exercises as the official trainees to strengthen my understanding of Linux-based development environments, EDA tools, and general engineering workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a structured record of:
- 💻 **Code files** and implementation scripts from daily tasks  
- 🧩 **Setup notes** and configuration details for tools and environments  
- 📄 **Documentation and reports** reflecting progress and learnings  
- ⚙️ **Command references** and automation utilities developed during the training  

By maintaining this repository, I aim to:
- Track my growth through version control (`git log`, commits, and branches)  
- Build disciplined documentation habits  
- Create a personal reference for future IC design and Linux development projects
